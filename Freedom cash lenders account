https://freedomcashlenders247.com/

Freedom cash lenders account requires a monthly income of only $800, somewhat less than the amounts other competitors require. It also offers fast service, arranging loans of up to $2,500 that you can access as soon as the next day. We’re confident that all six of these lending companies can cost you less money than would a payday lender.

The matching service that most closely resembles a payday lender is CashAdvance.com, which is the only one that offers very short-term loans tied to borrower pay periods. These loans range from $100 to $1,000 and are to be repaid on or before the borrower’s next payday.

This lending service doesn’t attempt to forecast the APR that the ultimate lender will charge. However, the CashAdvance.com website has a slider tool that estimates rates and fees. That slider has a range of APRs from 782% to 1,546% for a seven-day loan and 342% to 684% for 14-day loans.

These are the same kind of astronomic interest rates that payday lenders charge. On the other hand, the APR range for 12-month loans is 15% to 30%, which is in line with the rates you’ll find at the other lending services.
