Payday loans are extremely risky. They charge high interest rates, and if you miss a payment date, youâ€™ll be hit with substantial late fees. Personal loans are much safer, charge lower interest rates, offer fairer terms, and are frequently available to consumers with bad credit.

The six lending services in this review can connect you to a provider of personal loans. This is a convenient service that allows many lenders to offer you a loan, even with bad credit. Other payday advance loan alternatives include credit card cash advances and home equity lines of credit. Whichever lender you choose, always make sure you understand the terms before signing a loan agreement.
